## Changes Since Previous Deliverable
As this is the first deliverable, all changes provided here are new.

<div style="text-align: justify">
A playable GUI-based version of the game was introduced, along with supporting documentation
including javadocs, UML, and sequence diagrams, forming the View and Controller parts of the MVC pattern.

A document containing a user manual and design decisions has also been provided to allow the user
to understand the workings of the game and the reasoning behind the design choices that were made
in order to implement this GUI-based version of the game.

## Known Issues
- There are currently no known issues with the deliverables for milestone 2.

## Roadmap Ahead

<div style="text-align: justify"> For the next milestone (milestone 3), a solver that that uses either
depth-first or breadth-first search to solve a puzzle will have to be implemented. This solver will have
to be integrated in the GUI in terms of hints that can be given to the user. Also, undo/redo features
will have to be provided to the user, allowing them to backtrack as far back as necessary. We will also
have to provide unit tests for any new classes. In addition to this, we will have to pay close attention
to and keep track of any changes we make to the UML delivered in this milestone, and explain the reasons
as to why those changes were implemented. As we progress through the next milestone, we will also implement
the feedback given to us in relation to this deliverable by the TA who is assigned to our group.
