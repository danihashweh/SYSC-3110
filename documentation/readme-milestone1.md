## Changes Since Previous Deliverable
As this is the first deliverable, all changes provided here are new.

<div style="text-align: justify"> A playable text-based version of the game was introduced, along with supporting documentation
including javadocs, UML, and sequence diagrams, forming the Model part of the MVC pattern. A
document containing a user manual and design decisions has also been provided to allow the user
to understand the workings of the game and the reasoning behind the design choices that were made
in order to implement this text-based version of the game. </div>



## Known Issues
- Foxes are broken

## Roadmap Ahead

<div style="text-align: justify"> For the next milestone (milestone 2), the GUI-based version of the game must be implemented. This will
require us to complete the View and Controller portions of the MVC pattern. We will also have to setup
the testing frameworks that we will be using as we will have to provide unit tests for the Model aspect
of the project. In addition to this, we will have to pay close attention to and keep track of any changes
we make to the UML delivered in this milestone, and explain the reasons as to why those changes were
implemented. As we progress through the next milestone, we will also implement the feedback given to us
in relation to this deliverable by the TA who is assigned to our group.</div>
